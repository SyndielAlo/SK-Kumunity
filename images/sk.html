SK and Katipunan ng Kabataan (KK) were created through the Local Government Code of 1991
(Republic Act 7160) that provides opportunity for young people to directly participate in local governance;
Composed of all youth aged 15 to 21-year-olds;

In December 4, 1992, the first SK leaders were elected in nearly 42,000 barangays;

In 1995, with the passage of R.A. 8044, that created the National Youth Commission, the secretariat functions
of SK were transferred to the NYC which in effect replaced PCYA;

In 2002, the age bracket for KK membership was changed, through R.A. 9164, from 15 to 21-year-olds to
15 to 17-year-olds.
